# Python_Face_Detection_Project
Created a Face detection system Using Python openCV by using this we will be able to perform various actions using face detection and recognition such as attendance system etc.

OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision) is a computer vision library that contains various functions to perform operations on pictures or videos. 
It was originally developed by Intel but was later maintained by Willow Garage and is now maintained by Itseez. 
This library is cross-platform that is it is available on multiple programming language such as Python, C++ etc.

Here are steps to install OpenCV in your project to use its functionality.
To install OpenCV, one must have Python and PIP, preinstalled on their system. To check if your system already contains Python, go through the following instructions:

Open the Command line(search for cmd in the Run dialog( + R).
Remember python should be installed in your system.
Now run the following command: 
 pip install opencv-python
 
To confirm that if the openCV is corectly installed in your system, you can run following command:
python
>>>import cv2
>>>print(cv2.__version__)
